          <p><u>Educational Freedom and Independence</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I support educational freedom and independence for parents by
              having their education funds follow students based on their
              parentsâ€™ choice of schooling.
            </li>
            <li>
              I support a full audit (academic, financial, and personnel) of the
              education system and schools to provide parents and the public
              with full transparency.
            </li>
            <li>
              I will not assist candidates who seek or accept support from any
              teachers union or affiliated groups.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Universal Term Limits</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I support universal term limits for elected offices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Safe streets and schools</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I support our local law enforcement and oppose any efforts to
              defund police and public safety, knowing safe streets and safe
              schools are paramount to quality education.
